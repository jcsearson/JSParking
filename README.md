# Valet

A valet app that keeps daily records of valet cars (in & out) at any particular parking location.  The idea is to be simple and thus eliminating the ridiculous amount of paperwork that is currently being used to record locations of vehicles at all times while under the company responsability.

### Intended Application Process:

	1.  Accept input when user executes program.
	2.  Store input in an NSMutableArray.
	3.  Remove and add Car-objects as they come and go.
	4.  Write out the records from the previous day and reset the NSMutableArray.
